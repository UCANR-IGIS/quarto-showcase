There are three species of penguins in the dataset:

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
penguins |> 
  group_by(island, species) |> 
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop")
```

## Body Mass Comparison

Adelie and Chinstrap penguins have approximately the same body mass. Gentoo penguins however are noticeably bigger.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
